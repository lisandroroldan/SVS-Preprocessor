function varargout = form_9(varargin)
% FORM_9 MATLAB code for form_9.fig
%      FORM_9, by itself, creates a new FORM_9 or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = FORM_9 returns the handle to a new FORM_9 or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      FORM_9('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in FORM_9.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      FORM_9('Property','Value',...) creates a new FORM_9 or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before form_9_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to form_9_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
